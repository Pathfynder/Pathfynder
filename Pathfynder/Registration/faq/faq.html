		<ol>
			<li>Is Purdue the only school available on PathFynder?
				<p>Yes, unfortunately as of right now Purdue is the only school listed on PathFynder. We hope to change that in the near future.</p><br>
			</li>
			<li>How much information do I need to share with PathFynder about my classes?
				<p>You can share as much or as little as you choose, but we feel that the more you share, the more others will be able to benefit.</p><br>
			</li>
			<li>Why do I need a .edu email address to use PathFynder?
				<p>We at PathFynder feel that only those who are affiliated at a University, whether as staff or student, should be allowed to review aspects of that University. By doing this we hope to elimate reviews based on rumor or heresay, as well as prevent any reviews with malicious intent.
				</p><br>
			</li>
			<li>Why can't I add my own pages for classes?
				<p>At PathFynder we keep up to date with all courses offered by each University by pulling that information from the Universities themselves. By preventing user-added class pages we hope to eliminate duplications or junk classes. 
				</p><br>
			</li>
			<li>Why are there only reviews for classes that have been posted within the last four years?
				<p>At PathFynder we understand that university classes do not stay static. As schools reevaluate courses and restructure their programs, the content of classes can change very much within a four year timespan. Since our goal is to help current students with their classes we want the reviews to reflect the content of how classes are currently being taught. Because of this, we clean out the reviews for classes that have been posted over four years ago. 
				</p><br>
			</li>
			<li>Since reviews get removed from classes after four years, does that apply to the ratings given to those classes as well?
				<p>Yes, yes it does.</p><br>
			</li>
			<li>I've forgotten my password. How can I reset it?
				<p>You can reset your password by visiting the Account Settings page, which can be accessed in the top right corner of most pages</p><br>
			</li>
			<li>How can I change my email address?
				<p>We do not allow users to change their associated email address. We require that users be associated with a college and use email to verify that.</p><br>
			</li>
			<li>Is there a PathFynder mobile app?
				<p>There is currently no PathFynder mobile app.</p><br>
			</li>
			<li>Who can view the imformation on my profile?
				<p>At PathFynder we allow users to set their own privacy settings. We do encourage users to share as much information as they feel comfortable with, as to give other users more information to go off of.</p><br>
			</li>
			<li>How can I edit my privacy settings?
				<p>The privacy settings can be found in the Account Settings page, which can be accessed in the top right corner of most pages</p><br>
