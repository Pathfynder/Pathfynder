make a new meteor project
-meteor create registration_temp
-cd registration_temp
-meteor npm install
-meteor
and it should work
go to the browser and you should just see 4 text fields on the top left (they are hard to see) and a registration and login button. first register with an email
and password and then you can login with it. This does a basic check to make sure you register with an email.
