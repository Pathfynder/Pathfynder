First off make sure that mongodb is installed on your local machine.

Then, open three terminal tabs in the pathfynder meteor project folder.

In tab 1, run "meteor" in one to get the mongodb started up.

In tab 2, run meteor mongo.

In tab 3, navigate to the collections folder:
    then run:
    	mongoimport -h localhost:3001 --db meteor --collection course --type csv --file CoursesCSV.csv --headerline

This will import all of the data that you need to get all of the courses into the database.

Afterward, you can go to the meteor mongodb shell and run db.courses.find() to see the results
