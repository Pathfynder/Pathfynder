The testing suite we use for meteor is called mocha, specifically the mocha version from practicalmeteor

To run test scripts on PathFynder you must have previously added practicalmeteor:mocha to meteor.
You can do so by running
	meteor add practicalmeteor:mocha
within the PathFynder project directory
